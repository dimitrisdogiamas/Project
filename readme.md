In this project we are handling the JSON data from the file i had attached .  Firstly we had to parse the orders and display them as links in a list. In order to do that  i was asked to define the JSON  as a variable which i do using const JSON data and while doing that i created a function in order to generate order to the data. 
In addition to the first paragraph the goal was to use the data dynamically to generatae a list of order links. After we manipulate the Document Object Model to create html elements dynamically based on the JSON data. I create list items for each order and append them to the container('linkscontainet'). I  also create a popup element dynamically when an order link is clicked, displaying additional order details('displayOrderDetails' function).
I attach click event listeners to each order link. When an order link is clicked, it triggers the 'displayOrderDetails' function to show the order details popup.
At the end i present the order links and additional details in visually applying manner using Html and CSS. 

In coclusion this project was something i had never done before and it doesn't refer to any of my projects. I illustrated it using pure vanilla JavaScript
